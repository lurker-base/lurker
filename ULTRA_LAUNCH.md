# ULTRA LAUNCH MODE — Documentation

## Philosophy Shift

**Before:** Filter = reject → silence → illusion of security  
**After:** Filter = tag → information → human decision

## Risk Levels

| Level | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 🟢 LOW | Green | Good liquidity + activity |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | Orange | Acceptable but fragile |
| 🔴 HIGH | Red | Speculation only |

## Visual Separation

Cards now have:
- **Left border color** by risk
- **Background tint** by risk
- **Risk badge** with specific factors

## What This Means

### You WILL See:
- Dead tokens
- Honeypots  
- Basic scams
- Low liquidity plays

### This is NORMAL:
An early scanner without garbage is a late scanner.

## How to Use

1. **Scan the feed** — Look at risk colors
2. **Spot-check HIGH risk** — Manual verification required
3. **Watch MEDIUM** — Promising but monitor
4. **Consider LOW** — Best structure, but still DYOR

## Composite Score (Future)

```
launch_score = base_score 
               + volume_weight 
               + tx_velocity 
               + boost_bonus 
               - risk_penalty
```

## Memory Feature (Future)

Track tokens across scans:
- Seen 2+ times = more reliable
- HIGH → MEDIUM = improving
- MEDIUM → LOW = maturing

## Rule

**ULTRA MODE = observation + scoring, NOT execution**

Never auto-buy. Never auto-tweet everything.
The human decides. The scanner observes.
